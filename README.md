# Which city would you like to live in?

**City Fynders** *(Xiangyu Zhang, Wendan Yan, Yiran Zhang, Zhuochen Han)*

The most common question for people who decide to start a career or make a family is: where shall we live? The project intends to help people make choices for the city they want to live in. The current data include (TBD):
1. Environment related: city annual weather, precipitation, air pollution, water quality, forest coverage
2. Human related: Population, crime rate, unemployment rate, school and education quality
3. Economics related: cost of living, tax rates
4. Tertiary industry related: Restaurants, museums, bars

**Highlights:**
- Four Categories of indicators
- Customized  indicators
- Geographic Visualization on a map


The data will be added in the future if we consider other important indicators for these four categories.
