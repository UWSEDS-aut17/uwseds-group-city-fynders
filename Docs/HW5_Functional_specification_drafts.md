# Functional specification

Problem Statements
1. Select criteria for city ranking
2. Data collection and joint
3. Create tools for visualizing city and information about selected factors

## User profile

  The computational environments the user should be familiar with are listed as:
  - web pages
  - excel
  - python
  - Jupyter notebook
  
  *Zhuochen: This part we should discuss in details, such as whether we design GUI; if we want to show on the webpage, how to do the related API (for example wordpress?); if offline use, do we want to smart phone base or computer base?*

  Also, the user need to be willing to choose the criteria as well as allocate
  weight value to each selected factors themselves to score city.

## Elements

  There will be four main categories for users to choose in the database:
  - Environmental
  - Society
  - Economy
  - Tertiary Industry

*### Research part

 - Top environmental-friendly (social, developed or culturally important) cities
 - Any correlations of those factors? PCA analysis

### Tool part

- Data description and combination
- Default output from known factor weights: map info and other graphic outputs
- Interactive (user DIY) user profile*



## Use Case
  1. Select factors and get the rank based on each single factor
  2. Rank the city based on all the chosen criteria
  3. Rank the city by adding weight value for each factor
