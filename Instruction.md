#Homework 4: Project Repository

This homework is done as a group. You will be creating your team repository.

You should do the following:
- Create a repository for your team with a license and a .gitignore file.
- Construct an initial README file that describes the problem you are addressing (but not necessarily how you will address it). Include at least one image and a link to another web page.
- Create a Docs folder, and in that folder create a file named data.md. The document should have the following sections:
  - Requirements. List the kind of information required to answer the questions described in the README file.
  - Sources. List the data sets that you are considering using, their content, and their availability.
  - Evaluation. The core part of this section is a table that analyzes the choice of data. The columns of the table are data sets described in the "Data" section. The rows are requirements of the data based on the questions you want to answer. You should complete the cells in the table.

Each person in the team should make at least one commit to the repository.

Rubric. Items 1-4 are group grades. Item 5 is an individual grade.
1. Created repository with all team members as collaborators, and README file describes the questions addressed by the project. (1 pt)
2. data.md has a Requirements section with appropriate content. (1 pt)
3. data.md has a Sources section with appropriate content. (1 pt)
4. data.md has a Evaluation section with appropriate content. (1 pt)
5. You made a commit to the repository. (1 pt)

# Homework 5: Project functional specification

In this homework, you will create the functional specification for your class project. This is a group homework.

The functional specification should start with the problem statement outlined in the README of your project. Examples of problem statements are: (a) predict Seattle housing prices; (b) build a repository of easily accessed social science data; (c) create a tool for visualizing crime data in Seattle. The functional specification should be a markdown file in the Docs folder of your project repository.

The functional specification should have the following sections:

 - User profile. What computational environments are familiar to your user (e.g., web pages, excel, python). What your user knows and does not know about the domain of the problem statement. For example, a housing price predictor might require detailed knowledge of land tracts, something that the general public has little knowledge of.
 - Elements of the problem statement. You should subdivide the overall problem into pieces. These may be specific questions. For example, for housing prices, you might ask "What housing features most affect price?" If you are building a database or a tool, you should specify features that you think are important (e.g., description of the data schemas).
 - Use cases. Each use case should provide details about the interactions between the user and the system you are building. The responses provided by the user must be consistent with the user profile. For example, you should not expect a user who is a non-programmer to do python programming. A use case should specify a series of interactions between the user and the system to accomplish one of the elements of the problem statement. You should have at least 3 use cases.
 - Grading rubric. There will be one point for the "User Profile" and "Elements" sections and 3 points for the "Use Cases" section.
