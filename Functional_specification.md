Problem Statements
1. Select elements for city ranking
2. Data collection and joint
3. General analysis on four categories
4. Create tools for user to rank their personal living city preference which would be visualized on the US map

- User profile.
  The computational environments the user should be familiar with are listed as:
  - web pages (User need to choose elements and weight them by user's preference)
  - Jupyter notebook (We are planning to create an user interface to ask users to rank city in a board interface and hide the Jupyter notebook)

- Elements
  - There will be four main categories for users to choose in the database: Environmental, Society, Economy and Tertiary Industry.
  - Many cities may only have partial information, so we will only use the information for big cities which have enough data to do the analysis.
  - Visualization on the US map.
  - Create an user interface to make it easier to use.


- Use Cases
  - Users can see the general city ranking on each of the four categories.
  - Users need to pick which element matters to them in a provided list of elements in the user interface.
  - Users need to provide weight values for the elements they picked in the user interface.
  - A rough US map with 5 highest score cities would come out after users' input information
